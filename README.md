Our mission's main objective is retrieving physic parameters through the integrated sensors located in the payload. This data will be registered and store in a database to aloud post-processing efforts using Machine Learning and Deep Learning state-of-the-art algorithms. This novel analysis's scope is to contribute to the study of scientific theories and knowledge spread.
